# 🚗 Smart OBD Android

© 2026 Marouen Klai — All rights reserved.

A modern Android application that connects to a vehicle’s **OBD-II interface via Bluetooth (ELM327)** and provides **real-time diagnostics, sensor monitoring, and intelligent vehicle health reports**.

This project demonstrates practical experience with **Android development, Bluetooth hardware communication, clean architecture, and automotive diagnostics systems**.

# 🎯 Project Goal

Build a smart diagnostic Android application capable of:

- Reading live vehicle data
- Detecting and explaining OBD-II trouble codes (DTC)
- Visualizing engine data clearly
- Generating online diagnostic reports based on vehicle data
- Working offline for core diagnostics

---

# ✨ Key Features

## 🚘 Real-time Vehicle Monitoring

- Speed
- RPM
- Engine temperature
- Sensor data
- Live dashboard and charts

## 🔧 DTC Detection

- Scan and decode **OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes**
- Offline explanation for common codes

## 📊 Intelligent Diagnostic Reports

- Combines vehicle data and detected faults
- Sends structured vehicle data to a remote API
- Generates a clear diagnostic report

*(Requires internet connection and API token)*

# ⚙️ Communication Flow

1. App connects to **ELM327 Bluetooth adapter**
2. OBD commands are sent to the vehicle
3. Vehicle responses are parsed
4. Sensor data and DTC codes are extracted
5. ViewModel updates application state
6. UI updates dashboards and charts
7. Optional: vehicle data is sent to API to generate a diagnostic report

# 🔗 External Libraries & Tools

## 📦 AndroidOBD

https://github.com/barnhill/AndroidOBD

This Kotlin-native library provides the maintained **OBD command layer** for the app.

It helps with:

- Executing standard OBD commands
- Parsing raw ELM327 responses
- Simplifying OBD-II communication

Using this library ensures compatibility with most standard **OBD-II vehicles**.

---

## 🧪 ELM327 Emulator

https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator

This emulator simulates an **ELM327 adapter**, allowing development and testing **without a physical vehicle**.

It allows:
- Testing Bluetooth communication
- Simulating sensor values
- Debugging OBD commands
- Faster development cycles

This improves reliability before real-world testing.

---

# 🧪 Hardware Requirements

To run the application with a real vehicle you need:

- ELM327 Bluetooth OBD-II adapter
- OBD-II compatible vehicle
- Android device with Bluetooth support
